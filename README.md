## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a project to automate the integration of researcher data from Google Scholar.

### üéØ Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to automate the process of retrieving and integrating publication data for the university's top researchers from Google Scholar into a local database. This system will serve as the primary source for generating accurate reports on scientific production.

### ‚ú® Key Functionalities
* Connects to the Google Scholar API via SerpApi to retrieve public data.
* Fetches researcher profiles based on their unique author IDs using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
* Retrieves a complete list of all publications for a given researcher.
* Handles API keys and secrets securely using `.env` files.
* (Sprint 3) Stores this information in a structured MySQL database for analysis and reporting.

### üìà Project Relevance
This project solves the problem of manual, time-consuming, and error-prone data collection. It provides the university with an efficient, reliable, and up-to-date system for generating scientific production reports and analyzing research impact. By automating this workflow, staff can focus on analysis rather than data entry.

### üéØ Target Audience
This service is designed for institutions that need to track and analyze their research output, such as:
* **Universities & Academic Institutions:** For accreditation, global rankings, and faculty performance reviews.
* **Research Centers & Labs:** To justify funding and generate progress reports.
* **Corporate R&D Departments:** To monitor internal innovation and competitor activity.

### üí∞ Value Proposition
The core value of this service lies in transforming a manual, error-prone process into an efficient, automated system that delivers:
* **Cost Savings:** Drastically reduces the hours spent on manual data collection.
* **Data Accuracy:** Provides reliable, up-to-date information for credible reporting.
* **Strategic Insights:** Enables data-driven decisions on performance, funding, and hiring.

### üöÄ Monetization Model: Software as a Service (SaaS)
The proposed business model is a tiered subscription service, offering different levels of functionality to meet diverse needs.

* **Starter Tier:** Aimed at small teams or individual labs, tracking a limited number of researchers with monthly data updates.
* **Professional Tier:** Designed for entire departments or medium-sized institutions, offering a higher researcher limit, weekly updates, and data export features (CSV, PDF).
* **Enterprise Tier:** A full solution for large universities, providing unlimited researchers, daily updates, advanced analytics dashboards, and API access for integration with their internal systems.

### üåê Future Growth
Future expansion opportunities include:
* Integrating other data sources like Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed.
* Developing advanced citation and collaboration network analysis.
* Offering cross-institutional benchmarking services.

### Error 1: `ClassNotFoundException`
* **Situation:** I had just created the Model classes (`Author.java`, `Article.java`) and when trying to run the project for the first time, the program wouldn't start.
* **Error:**
    ```text
    Error: Could not find or load main class com.university.Main
    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.university.Main
    ```
* **Diagnosis:** The error meant that Java couldn't find the program's "entry point." This was because the project structure was still incomplete (missing the `Main.java` class, View, and Controller).
* **Solution:** I understood that I couldn't run an incomplete program. The solution was to follow the development plan and build the remaining components (`View` and `Controller`) before attempting another execution.

### Error 2: API Key Not Found (Environment Variable)
* **Situation:** With all the MVC code written, the program would run but stop immediately. I was using `System.getenv()` to read the API Key.
* **Error:**
    ```text
    Error: No se encontr√≥ la variable de entorno 'SERPAPI_KEY'.
    Por favor, config√∫rala antes de ejecutar el programa.
    ```
* **Diagnosis:** The `export SERPAPI_KEY="..."` command in the terminal is temporary and only works for that specific session. When running the program from an IDE or a new terminal, that variable is "forgotten".
* **Solution:** I adopted a more robust and professional solution:
    1.  Added the `dotenv-java` dependency to `pom.xml`.
    2.  Created a `.env` file to securely store the API Key.
    3.  Added the `.env` file to `.gitignore` to keep the secret key out of the repository.
    4.  Modified `Main.java` to use the new library and read the key from the `.env` file.

### Error 3: `.env` File Not Found (`DotenvException`)
* **Situation:** After configuring the `dotenv-java` library, the program still couldn't find the key.
* **Error:**
    ```text
    io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.DotenvException: Could not find ./.env on the file system
    ```
* **Diagnosis:** The "working directory" changed depending on how the program was executed (IDE vs. Maven command line), creating confusion about where the `.env` file should be.
* **Solution:** I implemented a "foolproof" solution: placed a copy of the `.env` file in **two locations**: one in the project root (`UniversityResearcherIntegration/`) and another inside the module folder (`app/`). This way, the program would always find it.

### Error 4: Maven Failure (`No POM in this directory`)
* **Situation:** This error appeared several times when trying to run the program from the terminal.
* **Error:**
    ```text
    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal ... there is no POM in this directory
    ```
* **Diagnosis:** The `mvn` command was being executed in the wrong folder. Maven needs to be in the same folder as the `pom.xml` file to work, which in my case was the `app/` folder.
* **Solution:** I established the "Golden Rule": Always navigate into the correct folder with `cd app` **before** executing any `mvn` command.

### Error 5: API Returning Partial Data
* **Situation:** The program finally ran without configuration errors but the result was `No se pudo obtener la informaci√≥n del autor`.
* **Logical Error:** The JSON response only contained metadata, not the actual author data.
* **Diagnosis:** The `author_id` of the first researcher I tested was returning an incomplete JSON payload for an unknown reason.
* **Solution:** As a diagnostic step, I changed the `author_id` in `Main.java` to that of another researcher (Yoshua Bengio), which allowed me to receive a complete JSON response.

### Error 6: JSON Parsing Error (`JsonSyntaxException` in `interests`)
* **Situation:** Using the new `author_id`, the program received data but crashed when trying to read it.
* **Error:**
    ```text
    JsonSyntaxException: ... Expected a STRING but was BEGIN_OBJECT at path $.author.interests[0]
    ```
* **Diagnosis:** My `Author.java` class expected a list of simple strings (`List<String>`) for the `interests` field, but the API sent me a list of more complex objects.
* **Solution:**
    1.  Created a new `Interest.java` class to match the object structure.
    2.  Modified `Author.java` to use `List<Interest>`.
    3.  Adjusted `AuthorView.java` to correctly read and display the titles from this new list of objects.

### Error 7: Publication List Not Appearing
* **Situation:** After fixing the `interests` issue, the program showed author data but still no publications.
* **Logical Error:** The article list wasn't being parsed from the JSON.
* **Diagnosis:** After analyzing the full JSON, I discovered two things:
    1.  The `articles` list was a "sibling" to the `author` object, not nested inside it.
    2.  The publication field was named `publication`, not `publication_info`.
* **Solution:**
    1.  Moved the `List<Article> articles` field from the `Author.java` class to the `ApiResponse.java` class.
    2.  Renamed the field in `Article.java` from `publication_info` to `publication`.
    3.  Adjusted `AuthorView.java` and `AuthorController.java` to handle this correct structure.

### Error 8: "Ghost" Compilation Error (`Unresolved compilation problem`)
* **Situation:** After restructuring the Model classes, the program refused to compile despite the code being syntactically correct.
* **Error:**
    ```text
    java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: ... missing type Article
    ```
* **Diagnosis:** Maven or the IDE were using "stale" or corrupted versions of the previously compiled files (`.class`), causing type confusion.
* **Solution:** I forced a complete and clean rebuild of the project using the command `mvn clean install`. This deleted all old compiled files and rebuilt the project from scratch, resolving the "ghost" error.
