# University Researcher Data Integration System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project to automate the integration of researcher data from Google Scholar.

### Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to automate the process of retrieving and integrating publication data for the university's top researchers from Google Scholar into a local database. This system will serve as the primary source for generating accurate reports on scientific production.

### Key Functionalities
* Connects to the Google Scholar API via SerpApi to retrieve public data.
* Fetches researcher profiles based on their unique author IDs.
* Retrieves a complete list of all publications for a given researcher.
* Stores this information in a structured MySQL database for analysis and reporting.

### Project Relevance
This project solves the problem of manual, time-consuming, and error-prone data collection. It provides the university with an efficient, reliable, and up-to-date system for generating scientific production reports and analyzing research impact. By automating this workflow, staff can focus on analysis rather than data entry.
